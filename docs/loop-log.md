# bevy_elements improvement loop — log

One improvement per iteration: captured, inspected, picked, researched, implemented, gated, shipped.
Iterations are appended newest-last.

## Iteration 1 — 2026-10-14 — the ground-fog volume darkened the sky it could not light

**Commit:** (this iteration) · **Sibling repos:** none touched.

### What changed, and why it ranked first

`FogPlugin`'s camera-following ground-fog `FogVolume` now fades out where Bevy cannot light it, and
carries the scene's *total* light where it can.

Bevy lights a `FogVolume` from the `DirectionalLight`s alone, and under cloud those carry only the
beam `T̄` — at full cover the sun's illuminance is literally 0 (instrumented: `beam = 0.0000`). The
cloud-scattered diffuse light reaches the camera's `AmbientLight` and never the volume, and Bevy's
`VolumetricFog.ambient_*` term cannot be the missing light (it is added once per ray, with no
density texture and no exposure — Bevy's own docs and this crate's note say so, which is why the
camera sets `ambient_intensity = 0`). So a thick cloud plus a short visibility made the volume
*remove* the sky and return nothing: a blizzard at noon rendered as a dark hole.

Adopted: `volume.density_factor = T̄ / (T̄ + 0.25 (1 − T̄))` and
`volume.light_intensity *= (T̄ + 0.25 (1 − T̄)) / T̄`, clamped 1–100. The two are exact reciprocals, so
the volume's radiance over its opacity is the scene's total light at every cover: it keeps its
appearance wherever it is lit and simply fades out of the frame where Bevy cannot light it, leaving
the sky and the distance fog to draw the whiteout. Ranked first because it is a **physically wrong
result visible in a shipping game's worst weather** (rank 1), not polish: an unlit volume that
occludes is an energy violation, and it is the most visible of the candidates at any hour.

Runner-up: the harness had no deterministic frame-sequence capture, which every later iteration
needs. It was built anyway as part of step 2 (below), but the fog defect outranked it as the
iteration's subject.

### Inspection findings

Captured before the change (`/tmp/i1/before/`, `/tmp/i1/ctl/`) and after (`/tmp/i1/after/`,
`/tmp/i1/fixed/`): a time-of-day sweep (05:30, 12:00, 20:12, 23:30) and all ten presets at noon,
1280 × 720, via `weather_tour`. The vision reviewer's crops are in `/tmp/i1/rev/`, `/tmp/i1/rev3/`,
`/tmp/i1/rev4/`.

Two reviews ran (both through the vision model; see "Harness" below):

1. **All ten presets at noon** — ranked Blizzard worst: "sky renders as a pitch-black nighttime
   celestial sphere" at `(20, 22, 26)` with a green, unwhitened ground; Snow's ground never whitens;
   DustStorm keeps a Rayleigh-blue zenith. It also flagged a bright horizon gap under Overcast
   (measured below as pre-existing) and particle-box edges.
2. **Blizzard and Fog, before vs after** (the crops that carry this iteration) — verdict "decisive
   improvement" for both. Blizzard: "the scene now unambiguously reads as daytime overcast rather
   than an anomalous midnight snowstorm under a 56.6° noon sun."

Measured, not just judged (luminance at x=1000, like-for-like captures with and without the fix):

| Preset | visibility | before | after | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Blizzard | 200 m | 59, 43 | 135, 153 | the defect: 4× darker than Clear, now brighter than Snow |
| Fog | 300 m | 179, **98** | 215, **146** | the `y=200` dip is the volume's dark band |
| Snow | 1500 m | 137, 146 | 154, 162 | lit anyway: small change |
| Thunderstorm | 1500 m | 119, 135 | 135, 152 | |
| Rain | 3000 m | 145, 153 | 151, 160 | |
| Overcast | 20 km | 153, 161 | 154, 161 | |
| Clear | 40 km | 190, 201 | 190, 201 | **unchanged**, as designed |
| DustStorm | 800 m | 115, 141 | 115, 141 | **unchanged**: its cloud is thin, so the beam is 1 |

Decisive control: with the volume's density forced to `0` and nothing else changed, Blizzard's noon
zenith read `(122, 124, 129)` against `(46, 47, 50)` with the volume — proving the volume, not the
clouds or the exposure, was eating the sky.

### Verification

- `cargo test` — 209 lib + all suites pass (2 new unit tests: the fade-out and the reciprocity).
- GPU tests `cargo test --release --tests -- --ignored --test-threads=1` — pass.
- `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` — clean.
- `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --no-deps --all-features` — clean.
- `cargo build --lib --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` — clean.
- `cargo build --examples --all-features` — clean.
- Visual: before/after crops at the same zoom, reviewed by the vision model (above). No perf change:
  the volume is the same size and march; only two scalars per frame differ.

### Harness

Two problems in step 2 were fixed, because every later iteration needs them:

1. **No frame-sequence capture.** `examples/common/mod.rs` now takes `ELEMENTS_SHOT_DIR`,
   `ELEMENTS_SHOT_EVERY` and `ELEMENTS_SHOT_FROM`; it waits for the frames to be written before
   exiting and captures until killed when there is no `ELEMENTS_FRAMES`. With `ELEMENTS_FRAMES` the
   run is a fixed 1/60 s step, so two runs simulate the same time (verified: identical simulated
   state; GPU output is not bit-deterministic, which the docs now say).
2. **Vision subagents fail on OpenRouter's `/responses` path.** A subagent that reads an image with
   a tool and then takes another turn gets `400 "Requests ending with a model turn are not
   supported"` from Google — reproduced and narrowed by replaying the exact request body: it is the
   replayed `reasoning` items. `PI_OPENROUTER_RESPONSES=0` (Chat Completions) accepts the same
   history; `/tmp/i1/vision.sh` runs a review that way. The in-process `modelRoles.vision` route is
   unusable for tool-using image review until this is fixed upstream.

### Visual review (`screenshot-reviewer`, after-crops, `/tmp/i5/review_a.md`)

The reviewer compared before/after at the same zoom levels and called the horizon finding
**resolved**: before, a 67 DN dip (sky L=227, shelf floor L=160, ground L=176) at `y = 85..104`
across the whole width; after, a monotone ramp (L=226 → 220 → 179 → 176) with **0 DN** of dip, on
both `Overcast` and `Rain`. It confirmed the ground now reads as snow-covered and matches the
weathered columns (`srgb(228, 229, 232)`), and that the 40 km plane shows no vertex swimming,
z-fighting or edge clipping against the atmosphere probe.

One **Noticeable** finding stands: the flat harness's snow ground is a uniform wash (std dev
< 0.4 DN, no relief). Cause measured, and it is a property of the scene rather than a regression:
the shipped snow path perturbs only `base_color`, `roughness` and `metallic` (`mirror.rs:149-151`)
and never the normal, so an up-facing plane lit only by the cloud-dimmed beam has nothing to vary
it — under Overcast the directional light's illuminance is near zero, so there are no cast
shadows either. On real terrain the same path follows the relief: `terrain_snow_g24` has a ground
std dev of 16 (mean 222) against the flat plane's 0, and the snow lies on the ridges. A snow
normal/albedo perturbation would be a new system, and so a research note first.

A second focused review (`/tmp/i5/review_b.md`) checked regressions and found **none**: Clear
ground identical (RMSE 3.9e-05, sampled (140,155,113) before and after) and PartlyCloudy unchanged
within dither (RMSE 7.56e-04, (132,146,112) → (132,146,113), cloud shadows matching), the 40 km
plane integrated to the horizon with no seam or step on any preset, DustStorm's ochre veil and
Fog's extinction uniform with no halos, dusk banding-free, night ground exactly (0,0,0) with
pin-sharp stars.

### Top 5 remaining items, ranked

1. **Blizzard's whiteout is not white yet.** Measured after the fix: sky 135–185 against snow 225,
   so the horizon line stays visible and a distant pillar reads with `ΔL ≈ 35 %` against the sky.
   The distance fog's in-scatter at maximum depth is brighter than the horizon sky. Rank 1: it is
   the same class of physically wrong result as this iteration's, in the same preset.
2. **A bright horizon gap / step under Overcast and Rain** (`y ≈ 270`, ~30 DN). Pre-existing
   (measured 36 DN before, 29 DN after this fix — it got slightly *smaller*), so not a regression;
   the reviewer found it in both passes. Distance-fog colour against the sky above the horizon.
3. **Snow's ground never whitens** under Snow or Blizzard in `weather_tour` (the ground-cover maps
   need terrain; the example's flat scene uses the plain ground material). Needs a decision:
   document it, or give the harness's ground plane the cover shading.
4. **DustStorm keeps a Rayleigh-blue zenith** with pristine white cumulus at 800 m visibility.
   The fog tint is only in the distance fog; the sky above is untouched.
5. **Particle-box edge** at 60 m under Rain/Thunderstorm: streaks stop abruptly against distant
   un-occluded geometry, and the draw has no far-particle haze.

Deferred/known, not ranked: the per-preset `docs/*.png` stills and `docs/tour.gif` were regenerated
this iteration only where the shipped build changed them.

## Iteration 3 — 2026-10-14 — the sky carries the weather's air (the whiteout's horizon line)

**Commit:** 816f473 · **Sibling repos:** none touched.

### What changed, and why it ranked first

The cloud composite now fogs **sky** pixels by the same air the distance fog gives every mesh:
`σ_air = σ_fog − 3.912/40 km`, read from the camera's own `DistanceFog` (`fog::sky_air_extinction`,
`CloudParams::air`, `composite.wesl`), multiplying the deck's radiance by `e^(−σ_air·t)` and adding
the fog colour times the same share. `t` is the path to the layer's entry, the conservative limit
(the veil beyond converges on the same colour, Validation 20).

Ranked first because it is the **rank-1 backlog item from iteration 2 and the top of iteration 1's
list**: a physically wrong result in the shipping crate's worst weather. The fog made the ground
converge on the fog colour but left the sky at the deck's own radiance, so a 200 m-visibility
blizzard showed a 40-level luminance step at the horizon — measured, and named "Blocker / inverted
luminance" by iteration 2's visual review.

Runner-up: snow's ground never whitens in `weather_tour` (backlog 3). It needs a terrain and the
ground-cover maps, so it is a harness change, not a renderer defect; the horizon step is visible in
every whiteout image in every scene.

### Inspection findings (iteration 2's captures, `/tmp/i2/`, and this iteration's `/tmp/i3/before/`)

Measured on the before build at the horizon (`x = 1000`): `tour_Blizzard.png` sky `(186, 193, 198)`
at `y = 269` against ground `(224, 228, 230)` at `y = 270`; `terrain_blizzard_air.png` sky
`(185, 188, 191)` at `y = 297` against terrain `(225, 228, 231)` at `y = 298`. `tour_Fog.png` had a
dark cloud band `(144, 147, 154)` between a bright fog base and the upper sky. Crops and the
before/after review are in `/tmp/i3/rev/`.

### Verification

Measured on the before/after captures at the horizon (`x = 1000`, mean of RGB), the step the
review called a blocker:

| scene | sky just above it | ground just below it | after |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tour_Blizzard` (200 m) | 192 | 225 | **227 / 225** — step gone |
| `tour_Fog` (300 m) | 191 (mid-sky band 148) | 216 | **219 / 216** — the dark band is gone |
| `tour_Snow` (1500 m) | 192 | 222 | **227 / 222** |
| `tour_DustStorm` (800 m) | 188 (chromatic clash) | 194 | **198 / 194**, the sky takes the ochre tint |
| `tour_Clear` (40 km) | — | — | **bit-identical, AE = 0** (also dawn, dusk, night) |
| `terrain_blizzard_g` | 175 | 177 | **227 / 227** |

The vision review's crops are in `/tmp/i3/rev/`; its verdict: "Fit to ship: horizon seam is
completely eliminated under low visibility while clear conditions remain bit-exact", with the
Blizzard horizon crop's standard deviation down from 4255.7 to 802.6 and `terrain_blizzard_g`'s
from 7565.6 to 186.6.

- `cargo test` — 211 lib + all suites pass (2 new unit tests: the air's arithmetic and monotonicity;
  the `Clear` preset pinned to `CLEAR_AIR_EXTINCTION`); `tour.gif` and the per-preset stills are
  regenerated from the new build and re-reviewed (no artifacts, all presets distinct).
- New GPU test `the_weather_air_makes_the_sky_the_fog_colour`: straight-up Blizzard, linear target,
  the frame's mean equals the fog colour to a half-float step (Δ 0.0026 of 6.91) with the air on and
  differs from it by half its luminance with the air suppressed (`CloudDebug::air = 0`).
- `the_far_veil_continues_the_marched_deck_at_full_cover` (Validation 20) now suppresses the air
  explicitly, because Deviation 29's fog saturated both sides of its 32 km boundary (ratio 1.000)
  and the test had gone blind; with the air off its measured ratios are 1.04–1.13 — the same values
  the build before Deviation 29 produced.
- `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`, `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc
  --no-deps --all-features`, `cargo build --lib --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` — see the gate run
  below.

### Top 5 remaining items, ranked

1. **Snow's ground never whitens** under Snow or Blizzard in `weather_tour` (backlog 3 from
   iteration 1). The harness's flat ground uses the plain material; giving it the ground-cover
   shading (or moving the whiteout shots to `terrain_tour`) would let every later whiteout claim be
   judged on a scene that can actually be white.
2. **DustStorm keeps a Rayleigh-blue zenith** (backlog 4) with white cumulus at 800 m visibility:
   the fog tint is only in the distance fog; the sky above is untouched. The air mechanism added
   this iteration is the hook: the dust presets' *colour*, not just their extinction, is what is
   missing (`fog_hue` already tints the distance fog for dust).
3. **Particle-box edge** at 60 m under Rain/Thunderstorm (backlog 5): streaks stop abruptly against
   distant un-occluded geometry, and the draw has no far-particle haze.
4. **A bright horizon gap / step under Overcast and Rain** (~30 DN at `y ≈ 270`, iteration 1's
   backlog 2): pre-existing before iteration 1 and only slightly reduced by it; the air added this
   iteration changes it (Overcast's air is 9.78×10⁻⁵ m⁻¹), so re-measure it against these captures.
5. **Cloud edge stair-stepping** (iteration 2's review 4): 1–3 px discrete steps along cloud
   silhouettes in `tour_Clear`, `tour_Fog` and `tour_DustStorm`; a filtering or noise-octave
   question, not an energy one.

## Iteration 4 — 2026-10-15 — snow lies on the ground the examples show

**Commit:** `177754b` · **Sibling repos:** none touched.

### What changed, and why it ranked first

The examples' flat ground plane was a bespoke `StandardMaterial` extension that sampled only the
cloud shadow map (`examples/common/ground.rs` + `ground.wesl`, since deleted), so under `Snow`
and `Blizzard` `weather_tour` rendered olive-drab ground where the boxes and columns beside it
carried `WeatheredMaterial` and whitened. Two layers, one fix.

1. **Material.** `test_scene` now gives its plane `WeatheredMaterial` (the crate's own), so the
   example ground darkens and glosses in rain, runs with streaks and whitens under snow exactly as
   a consumer's mesh does. The duplicate shader is gone.
2. **Plane extent.** 2 km → 40 km. A 2 km plane leaves a sliver of unlit below-horizon
   atmosphere between its edge (1 km away) and the horizon; `ground_haze` (clouds.md Deviation 28)
   paints the camera's distance fog over it, and the result is a dark shelf at the horizon.
3. **Capture.** `SurfaceWeathering` and the cover maps advance on *game time*, and `ELEMENTS_HOUR`
   holds the clock, so a still of the first frame integrates 0 h of the held preset: no material
   could ever whiten in a screenshot. `ELEMENTS_GROW_HOURS=n` (examples/common, `grow_weather`)
   advances the clock one hour a frame for `n` frames plus one arming frame, then rewinds by what it
   advanced. Both consumers record the clock on their first frame and integrate nothing from it, so
   the arming frame is needed; and a jump larger than 24 h is clamped by both, so the growth is
   split into one-hour chunks. The captured hour, sun and sky stay the example's own.

Why it ranked first: rank 1 on iterations 1 and 3's backlogs, and the reviewer's finding 3
("ground under `tour_Snow` fails to read as snow-covered"). It beats the runner-up (iteration 3's
backlog item 2, the bright horizon step under Overcast and Rain) because the horizon step is
*physically* the fogged ground against a bright deck and moves only 29 DN, while a snowing sky over
green grass is a wrong result the crate can fix.

### Inspection findings

Before/after pairs are in `/tmp/i4/before/`, `/tmp/i4/after/`, crops in `/tmp/i4/crops/` and
`/tmp/i4/crops_after/`. The reviewer's before findings: `rain_sky` streaks at Δ ≤ 8 RGB levels
(versus > 50 against ground); `snow_ground` olive-drab; `overcast_horizon` a 66 DN drop (sky
L=225) to a band floor of L=159, 16 DN below the ground it meets. Measured on the new build,
x=16 column, rows 264-280 (`magick -crop 1x17+16+264`):

| scene | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `tour_Overcast` horizon shelf | 224→194→156 (valley) →173 | 224→220→203→194→…→173 (ramp) |
| `tour_PartlyCloudy` horizon | 219→182→155 (valley) →196 | 219→211→204→201→…→196 |
| `tour_Clear` horizon | 203→207→170 (step) | 203→209→193→…→170 |

The 66 DN valley under Overcast and PartlyCloudy is gone: after the fix the same column is a
monotone ramp (224→203→194→186→181→177→173) with no dip below the ground it meets. Clear's
30 DN step is unchanged (clear air has no fog to converge on, and the Clear preset's plane edge
was never the cause).

### Verification

- `cargo test`: 242 tests, **211 pass, 31 ignored** (GPU, not run), 0 fail.
- `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`: clean.
- `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --no-deps --all-features`: clean.
- `cargo build --lib --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`: clean.
- GPU tests, one suite per process: `clouds::` 10 pass, `terrain::` 8 pass, `cover::` 5 pass /
  **2 fail (pre-existing)**, `dust::` 6 pass, `voxel::` **1 fail (pre-existing)**, integration
  (`tests/gpu_*`) 28 pass. The two cover failures (`gpu_wetness_soaks_and_dries_on_the_formula`,
  probe `Some(0.992)` against an expected `< 0.1` after drying, and
  `gpu_surface_weathering_follows_the_map`) were reproduced on **pristine HEAD** with this work
  stashed — a wetness-tolerance defect in the cover map, not a regression. The voxel failure
  (`gpu_voxel_snow_covers_the_top`, `src/voxel/gpu_tests.rs:318`) reproduces 2/2 at pristine HEAD
  with swap 1 at 23.05 h and 22.80 h against `20.7 ± 2.0 h` — a ~+2.1 h bias past the window, with
  no simulation-side `src/` drift since the test was written (the only later edits are a type
  alias and a constant rename). Both are logged below as backlog item 2.
- Ground material, snow and growth, before → after: `tour_Snow` (155,167,141) → (228,229,232) at 6 h;
  `tour_Blizzard` (155,167,141) → (228,229,232); `terrain_snow_g` (143,162,132) → (228,230,232) at 24 h
  (`CoverStats::simulated_s` = 86 400 s exactly, `terrain_blizzard_g` same).
- Determinism: two `ELEMENTS_GROW_HOURS=6` runs give identical ground (228,230,232) and identical
  status-line hour pixels (158,158) — the warm-up is reproducible.
- Regression: `ELEMENTS_GROW_HOURS=0` is bit-identical to the build before this change. Clear
  ground (140,155,112) before and after; PartlyCloudy ground (132,146,112) before and after.
- Cost: the change is `examples/`-only plus one stale `src/terrain/render.wesl` comment; no shader,
  kernel, or uniform changed, so the cost tables in the notes stand.

### Top 5 remaining items, ranked

1. **Snow has no surface relief on a flat ground.** The shipped path (`mirror.rs:149-151`) moves
   `base_color`, `roughness` and `metallic` and never the normal, so on the harness's flat plane
   under Overcast (beam ≈ 0, no cast shadows) the snow is a uniform wash (std dev < 0.4 DN).
   Real terrain follows the relief (std dev 16 on `terrain_snow_g24`), so this is the flat plane's
   missing normal detail, not a bug. A snow normal perturbation needs a research note and corpus
   search first — `snow-cover.md` cites no crust source.
2. **Three GPU tests fail on pristine HEAD.** `gpu_wetness_soaks_and_dries_on_the_formula`
   (probe `Some(0.992)` vs expected `< 0.1` after drying at `src/cover/gpu_tests.rs:783`) and
   `gpu_surface_weathering_follows_the_map` (`:846`) both fail without this work — the wetness map
   reaches 0.99 after the test's drying window, so either the drying constant or the assertion's
   tolerance is wrong. `voxel::gpu_tests::gpu_voxel_snow_covers_the_top`
   (`src/voxel/gpu_tests.rs:318`) fails 2/2 with swap 1 at 22.8–23.1 h against `20.7 ± 2.0 h`: a
   consistent ~+2.1 h bias with 0.25 h run-to-run variance and no simulation-side `src/` drift
   since the test was written, so either the swap is genuinely late or the window is tighter than
   the readback-observed swap time allows. Together the only things blocking a clean
   `cargo test --release --lib -- --ignored`; a real defect in a shipped domain.
3. **The horizon step under Clear** (~30 DN at `y ≈ 270`): physically the fogged ground against a
   bright deck; the only remaining horizon discontinuity in the showcases, and the reviewer's
   before-review found it under every long-visibility preset.
4. **DustStorm keeps a Rayleigh-blue zenith** with white cumulus at 800 m visibility (backlog 4).
5. **Rain streaks wash out against the bright sky** (reviewer finding 2: Δ ≤ 8 levels against the
   overcast deck, > 50 against the ground). A contrast question in the precipitation draw.

## Iteration 5 — 2026-10-15 — the horizon shows no dark band past the edge of a finite ground

**Commit:** `c9131e6` (code + test + docs + stills). **Sibling repos:** none touched.

### What changed, and why it ranked first

The extra instruction for this run was a full aesthetic inspection: every domain the crate ships,
captured and reviewed by the vision model (`screenshot-reviewer`, Gemini Flash), then the single
most valuable defect fixed.

Below-horizon sky pixels with no mesh behind them — past the edge of quickstart's hills, the lake
basin, any finite terrain — drew Bevy's unlit bare-planet term. `ground_haze` (clouds.md
Deviation 28) fogs over the planet's own root, and from a low camera that root is *near* (23 m at
5° below the horizon from 2 m), so the transmittance is ~1 and nothing fogs: the pixel is the dark
planet under a lit, fogged scene. Measured on the lake at three columns: a 33 DN dark band at the
horizon (193 against fogged ground 226); reproduced headlessly in the new GPU test at 0.59× the
fog colour (3.835 against haze 6.553 on the linear target). The fix floors the fog distance at
the march range (`MAX_MARCH_M`, 32 km): a below-horizon pixel with no mesh shows ground the fog
has fully carried, because nothing nearer than the far field is visible beyond a finite terrain.
It beat the runner-up (precipitation and dust washing out against bright backgrounds) because it
is a physically-wrong rank-1 artifact isolated to one shader line with a regression test, while
the washout is a particle-compositing redesign that touches every precipitation golden.

### Inspection findings

Capture: `/tmp/i6` — 35 sequential runs over every example domain (`capture.sh`): the five
times of day, ten sequences (cloud build, rain, snow, lightning-lead, wind, lake ripples, flood
flow, dust, fog roll), two terrain seeds (42, 7), two camera heights (6 m and 120–400 m), erosion
before/after, voxel snow, weathered town (rain wide + wall, snow, fog). Reviews: eleven
Gemini Flash batches (`/tmp/i6/reviews/b1.md` … `b11.md`), crops in `/tmp/i6/crops/`.

- **Blocker, reclassified: the "dark horizon shelf" of iteration 4's backlog was the harness's
  own status line.** The reviewer's b6 finding (68 DN, rows 10–56 of `cover_rain_gnd`) is the
  semi-transparent debug band the harness burns into the top of every capture; b11 read it
  verbatim ("Clear (forced) … vis 40000 m") and confirmed no shelf exists in the sky below it
  (row-to-row ≤ 1–2 DN). Crop below row 56 when judging horizons; AGENTS now says so.
- **Precipitation and dust wash out against bright backgrounds** (the runner-up, now rank 1):
  rain streaks ΔDN ≤ 3 against a 227-DN overcast sky while Δ64–75 against the ground
  (`b3_*`); snow flakes Δ ≤ 5 against the sky, Δ36–44 against ground (`b4s_*`); 60 000 dust
  sprites move the frame by ≤ 4 DN over 14 frames — "the storm appears as static homogeneous
  fog" (`b5_dust_*`). Streak advection, flake motion and shelter occlusion are otherwise clean.
- **Snow has no normal-dependent shading under an overcast sky** (`b7_snow_seed07_aerial.png`):
  the 24 h warm-up saturates the terrain white but the aerial view measures 0.56 DN of standard
  dev across 840 k pixels — Bevy's ambient is flat over normals and the beam is zero. This is
  iteration 4's backlog item 1 seen from the air, on real terrain.
- **Time of day** (`b1_*`): the horizon is continuous at all four hours; the dawn gradient is
  smooth to ≤ 1 DN per row; stars are 1–2 px points; night ground sits at (4,4,5). Two
  capture-design facts: `day_night`'s camera (yaw 106.7°) never faces the sun (dawn azimuth 64°,
  sunset 303°), and the moon is set at 23:30 (−12.3°) — the showcase cannot show either disc.
  The night sky reading brighter than dusk (16.1% vs 12.5% mean) is the Ward/Larson auto
  exposure the note adopts (celestial.md, "Auto exposure"), not a defect.
- **Clouds** (`b2_*`): cumulus edges monotone, no ghosting between consecutive accumulation
  frames (Δ ≤ 1 DN), overcast deck uniform. The shadow-contrast question is unresolved (the
  crop missed the cloud mass at Clear's 0.05 cover).
- **Lightning, wind, water, materials, fog** (`b4`, `b5`, `b9`, `b10`, `b6`): bolt geometry
  clean, tree sway anchored and coherent, lake shoreline sub-pixel continuous with no shimmer,
  ripple motion structured, flood channel flush with no gaps, wall streaks localized with clean
  onset, pavilion dry contrast sharp, fog volume against geometry natural. Minor: mid-flash is
  dimmer than the first stroke because `STRIKE_LEAD=6` (+100 ms) outlives the ~43 ms decay
  (the doc says "inside the flash"); splash rings sparse; near-shore foam sub-pixel at nadir;
  the flood marker sits outside the capture's frustum; fresh erosion cuts facet; the status text
  clips at the window edge.
- **Verified physical, not defects:** thin snow lets grass through (`cover_snow_gnd` reports
  7.7 mm and melting); no puddles at 1.6 mm of water (the model's threshold is 2 mm); sequence
  frames 0–12 render before the pipelines are ready (skip them when cropping pairs).

### Verification

- New GPU test `clouds::gpu_tests::the_horizon_sky_is_the_fog_colour_under_a_deck` (6 m eye,
  1° up, `Snow`): above the horizon the veil is the fog colour (6.543 against haze 6.553); below
  it the planet was 0.59× the fog colour and is now the haze. Red before the fix, green after.
- Before/after captures (`/tmp/i6/shots` vs `/tmp/i6/after`, reviewed in `b11.md`): the lake's
  horizon band lifts 193 → 226 DN at x = 100, 1400, 1800 with meshed terrain bit-identical
  (Δ 0 DN); `weathered_town`'s 40 km plane compares AE 0; flood fringes converge into the
  fogged ridge; open sky Δ 1 DN. The controls `tod_noon` (AE 1.4e-8) and the terrain seed-42
  ground shot (AE 2.4e-5, dither) are unchanged.
- `cargo test`: 211 pass, 0 fail (32 ignored, GPU). `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features
  -- -D warnings`, `RUSTDOCFLAGS=-D warnings cargo doc --no-deps --all-features`, and the
  wasm32 build: clean.
- GPU suites, one process per module: `clouds::` 11 pass in two parts (see below), `terrain::`
  8 pass, `dust::` 6 pass, integration (`tests/gpu_*`) 28 pass; `cover::` and `voxel::` fail
  exactly the three pre-existing tests logged under iteration 4's backlog item 2 — reproduced
  there first, unchanged here.
- New test-infrastructure fact: `clouds::gpu_tests` now has eleven tests and the eleventh
  sequential wgpu instance cannot get an adapter (`GPU_NOT_FOUND`); the suite passes as
  ten-plus-one. Recorded in AGENTS.

### Top 5 remaining items, ranked

1. **Precipitation and dust wash out against bright backgrounds.** Rain streaks Δ ≤ 3 against
   a 227-DN overcast sky, snow flakes Δ ≤ 5, dust sprites ≤ 4 DN over 14 frames, while each is
   strongly visible against dark ground. The particles carry a fixed radiance; physically a
   flake or streak is lit like any surface — about 0.8× the sky behind it, so it should read
   slightly dark against the deck and bright against the ground. A compositor change in the
   precipitation draw, with the note's deviation and contrast tests on both backgrounds.
2. **Snow has no normal-dependent shading under an overcast sky** (iteration 4's item 1, now
   measured from the air: 0.56 DN across 840 k pixels on saturated terrain). Bevy's ambient is
   flat over normals; an overcast dome is not. Needs a corpus search (overcast sky-luminance
   models) and a research note before any code.
3. **Three GPU tests fail on pristine HEAD, and the clouds suite needs two processes.**
   `cover::gpu_wetness_soaks_and_dries_on_the_formula` (probe 0.992 against < 0.1 after
   drying), `cover::gpu_surface_weathering_follows_the_map`, and
   `voxel::gpu_voxel_snow_covers_the_top` (swap 1 at 22.8–23.1 h against 20.7 ± 2.0, a +2.1 h
   bias with no simulation-side drift since it was written). Plus the adapter cap above.
4. **`day_night` never shows the sun or the moon.** The camera yaw (106.7°) points away from
   the dawn sun (64°) and the sunset sun (303°), and the 23:30 moon is set (−12.3°): the discs
   the domain exists to render cannot appear in the showcase. An `ELEMENTS_HEADING` default that
   tracks the sun at dawn/sunset and a moon-up hour would show them.
5. **The small cosmetic set.** `ELEMENTS_STRIKE_LEAD=6` lands +100 ms after the trigger, past
   the ~43 ms flash decay, so "inside the flash" is wrong in `storm`'s doc; splash rings are
   sparse on a 6 m roof; near-shore foam is sub-pixel at nadir (view-ray thickness); the flood
   marker is outside the capture frustum; fresh erosion cuts facet; the status line clips at
   the window's right edge.

## Iteration 6 — 2026-10-15 — a dust storm streams instead of sitting as static fog

**Commit:** `19db0a4` (code + note + CHANGELOG + the three dust stills). **Sibling repos:** none.

### What changed, and why it ranked first

The full-feature inspection continued (the extra instruction): the iteration-5 backlog's rank 1
was "precipitation and dust wash out against bright backgrounds". Re-measured properly this
iteration — full-band histograms instead of the single 240 × 50 patches the finding came from —
two thirds of it dissolves:

- **Rain reads** (`before6/rain_day.png`, sky band rows 120–260): 50 150 of 161 000 pixels
  (31 %) sit 25–75 DN below the 225 sky — streaks were visible all along; the earlier "Δ ≤ 3"
  was measured on a streak-free patch.
- **Snow reads, sparsely** (`before6/snow_day.png`): flake cores reach 190–204 against a 225
  sky (Δ 21–35) on 4 558 pixels; the earlier "Δ ≤ 5" sampled a faint edge.

The third member was real: **dust sprites were genuinely invisible.** They are drawn at the
plan's 2 mm grain size, which is 0.02–0.1 px anywhere in the 60 m box, so the draw's own
sub-pixel coverage rule (`draw.wesl`, Garg & Nayar 2007 Eqs. 21–22) fades their opacity to
≈ 0.01: 1 247 pixels of 849 920 reached 150–199 against a 224 background and none below 150,
and the reviewer measured ≤ 4 DN of movement over 14 frames — "the storm appears as static
homogeneous fog" (`b5_dust_*`). The example's stated behaviour ("dust sprites stream past the
camera with the wind") did not exist on screen. That is a visible, physically-wrong-at-the-pixel
rank-1 defect in a shipped showcase, and it beat the runner-up (snow's flat overcast shading,
which needs a whole lighting-model note) because it is one constant in one vertex path with a
direct visual oracle.

**The fix:** the draw diameter (`DUST_SPRITE_DRAW_M`, 0.35 m) and the sprite opacity
(`DUST_ALPHA`, 0.5, below a flake's 0.8 so a cluster is a veil rather than a puff) are now
separate from the grain size. `DUST_SIZE_M` (2 mm) remains the size the sprite *extinction*
accounts — Validation 8's 8.7 · 10⁻⁷ m⁻¹ is untouched, as are the counts, the motion, the fog
and every other physics number. `dust.md` Deviation 15 records the split with the measurements.

### Inspection findings

Crops in `/tmp/i6/crops/` (`b12_*`), review in `/tmp/i6/reviews/b12.md` (Gemini Flash,
`screenshot-reviewer`):

- **After the fix the storm reads as particulate:** 26 % of the frame moves more than 6 DN
  (219 924 px), cores reach 150–199 (55 316 px), the tan chromaticity is preserved
  (mean (221, 208, 189) → (216, 203, 183); R:G:B ratio 1.17 : 1.10 : 1.00 before and after),
  and there are no opaque blobs (min channel 181/165/143), no whiteout, no quad edges. The
  reviewer's verdict: *"Does the dust storm now READ as streaming particulate rather than
  static haze? Yes … No artifact introduced … Ship."*
- **Temporal check** (`b12_dust_seqA/B_2x.png`, frames 3 apart): mean difference 4.48 DN,
  clusters advect downwind by (−2…−6, −8…−15) px over 3 frames, edges fade gracefully at the
  box boundary — continuous drift, no popping.
- **Corrections to last iteration's findings** (recorded so the backlog stops carrying them:
  the rain and snow "washout" entries were single-patch sampling artifacts — full-band
  histograms above).

### Verification

- `cargo test`: 211 pass, 0 fail. `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`,
  `RUSTDOCFLAGS=-D warnings cargo doc --no-deps --all-features`, wasm32 build: clean.
- GPU suites, one process each: `clouds::` 10 + 1 (two parts, the adapter cap), `terrain::` 8,
  `dust::` 6, integration 28 across 11 binaries; `cover::` 5/2 and `voxel::` 0/1 fail exactly
  the three pre-existing tests from iteration 4's backlog item 2 — no new failures.
- `precipitation` unit tests: 16 pass (the sprite extinction pin is unchanged).
- Before/after captures under identical env (`/tmp/i6/before6` vs `/tmp/i6/after6`) and the
  motion sequence (`/tmp/i6/seq6/dust`); the three README dust stills regenerated from the new
  build (600/600/4200 frames, the commands the README documents).

### Top 5 remaining items, ranked

1. **Snow has no normal-dependent shading under an overcast sky** (iteration 5's rank 2):
   saturated terrain reads 0.56 DN of standard deviation across 840 k pixels from the air, and
   the flat-ground case reads < 0.4. Bevy's ambient is flat over normals; an overcast dome is
   not. Needs a corpus search (overcast sky-luminance models) and a research note before code.
2. **Three GPU tests fail on pristine HEAD, and the clouds suite needs two processes**
   (unchanged): `cover::gpu_wetness_soaks_and_dries_on_the_formula`,
   `cover::gpu_surface_weathering_follows_the_map`, `voxel::gpu_voxel_snow_covers_the_top`
   (swap 1 at 22.8–23.1 h against 20.7 ± 2.0), plus the eleven-instance adapter cap.
3. **`day_night` never shows the sun or the moon** (unchanged): camera yaw 106.7° against the
   dawn sun at 64° and the sunset sun at 303°; the 23:30 moon is set at −12.3°. The discs the
   domain exists to render cannot appear in the showcase.
4. **The small cosmetic set** (unchanged): `STRIKE_LEAD=6` outlives the ~43 ms flash decay
   (the doc says "inside the flash"); splash rings sparse on a 6 m roof; near-shore foam
   sub-pixel at nadir; the flood marker sits outside the capture frustum; fresh erosion cuts
   facet; the status line clips at the window's right edge.
5. **Cloud shadow contrast under Clear is unverified** (carried from iteration 5): the crop
   missed the cloud mass, so neither confirmation nor denial. Capture with the shadows in frame
   (choose a heading where cumulus sit upwind) and measure the ground's shadow depressions.

## Iteration 7 — 2026-10-15 — snow relief reads: the overcast dome shades by orientation

**Commit:** `d24c704` (two shaders, the example harness, note, CHANGELOG). **Sibling repos:** none.

### What changed, and why it ranked first

The extra instruction again: inspect every feature with the vision model. The pick is iteration
6's rank 1 (carried from 4 and 5): **snow under an overcast sky is a physically wrong flat
result** — saturated terrain reads 0.56 DN of standard deviation across 840 000 pixels from the
air, because Bevy's ambient is uniform over normals, the beam is ~0 under cloud, and no term in
the stack varies with orientation. It beat the runner-up (`day_night` never framing the sun or
moon) because it is a wrong rendering of a shipped domain in every overcast showcase, while the
runner-up is a showcase's camera choice.

**The fix** (`src/weathered/weathered.wesl`, `src/terrain/render.wesl`, inlined at both call
sites): the lit colour is multiplied by `mix(1, shape(N_y), 1 − T_deck)` where `shape` is the
Moon & Spencer (1942) CIE overcast dome — `L_γ = L_z(1 + 2 sin γ)/3`, the horizon a third of the
zenith (Dáru & Kittler, ESIM 2002, eq. 1; the corpus held no dome model, so the source was
fetched) — integrated over the dome with the ground's bounce at the crate's own albedos into
top 1 / side 0.68 / bottom 0.5, then re-fitted as `1 − 0.35·(1 − N_y)^0.3` [INFERENCE] after the
review's *Adjust*: the pure linear dome is physically honest but gives ≤ 2 DN on 5–15° slopes
(14 pixels ≥ 3 DN on the aerial view), because `cos θ` is flat near vertical; the power curve
keeps the anchors (side 0.65, bottom 0.57) and puts the gradient where the demand is. The ramp
is the raw cloud-map transmittance over each ground point (`cloud_deck`), not
`camera_transmittance`, which is wall-clock-smoothed and varied 0.18–0.77 between identical
runs. Clear air evaluates `T_deck = 1` → factor exactly 1.

The showcase's boxes, columns and spheres were `StandardMaterial` and never reached the shader
(round-1 finding): they now take `WeatheredMaterial` through `ShowcaseProp`, adopted like
`GroundPlane`.

### Implementation findings worth keeping (all cost an hour each)

- **An additive ambient correction clamps to black.** The first form added
  `EnvBRDFApprox × ambient × (shade − 1)` after `apply_pbr_lighting`; sized against Bevy's
  interior ambient it overshoots through the cloud-shadow `ratio` and went negative (forced-
  overcast terrain rendered 0–1 DN). Multiplying the lit colour cannot go negative, and under a
  deck the beam inside it is ~0, so it shapes the fill alone (the beam's share at partial cover
  is the deviation's stated cost).
- **`AmbientLight` is ~0 in this crate** — the additive delta measured ≈0.004 linear where a
  flat ambient would be ~5; the fill arrives with the environment-map light. Any future ambient
  work must scale the lit colour or the env light, not `lights.ambient_color`.
- **A viz that writes a bare `vec4` where `FragmentOutput` is required fails the pipeline**
  ("Entry point fragment … invalid") and the capture then shows the *fog background* — three
  rounds of readings were taken off a failed shader. Viz must set `out.color` and `return out`.
- **The tonemap runs outside the material shader**, so early-returned debug values come back
  ACES+sRGB-encoded; calibrate with constants sentinels before reading them (`0.1/0.4/0.8` →
  `91/149/194`).
- **`ElementsGlobals::camera_transmittance` is smoothed on wall-clock time** — run-dependent
  (0.18–0.77 for identical commands), unusable as a deterministic ramp; the cloud map itself is
  state-derived and deterministic.

### Inspection findings

Reviews in `/tmp/i7/review_b13.md` (round 1, *Adjust*) and `/tmp/i7/review_b14.md` (round 2,
*Ship*), Gemini Flash `screenshot-reviewer`, captures in `/tmp/i7/{before,final,final2}`:

- Round 1: the wash was still flat (99.99 % of the aerial ≤ 1 DN), the showcase props unchanged
  — the reviewer read `examples/common/mod.rs` and found the wiring gap — and the controls
  passed (AE with 2 DN fuzz: 0).
- Round 2: aerial spread 2.35 → 3.28 DN with "clear topological definition and structural
  relief across terrain crests"; overcast ground 629 116 px ≥ 3 DN, 30 196 ≥ 7, peak 9 DN,
  "hillsides and cut banks read unambiguous orientation-dependent shading"; box sides −9 to
  −15 DN with top caps exactly preserved; controls still fuzz-0; no banding, no Mach bands, no
  cloud-map-edge seam.

### Verification

- `cargo test`: 12 suites ok (211 lib tests), 0 fail. `cargo clippy --all-targets
  --all-features -- -D warnings`, `RUSTDOCFLAGS=-D warnings cargo doc --no-deps --all-features`,
  wasm32: clean (clippy needed a `type` alias for the adoption query).
- GPU suites: `terrain::` 8, `dust::` 6, `clouds::` 10 + 1 (two parts), `tests/gpu_weathered`
  4, integration 11 binaries — all pass; `cover::` 5/2 and `voxel::` 0/1 fail exactly the three
  pre-existing tests from iteration 4's backlog item 2.
- Controls: `tour_clear` AE 0.026 %, `terrain_clear_gnd` AE 0.075 %, both PAE 1 DN and fuzz-2
  AE 0 — clear air renders as before within dither (the props' material fork).

### Top 5 remaining items, ranked

1. **Aerial snow relief is still only 3–6 DN** (round 2 passed it, but it is the weakest
   surface): from 300 m the terrain's slopes are gentle and even the fitted curve gives ≤ 7 DN
   there. The next step is not a steeper curve but occlusion: a sky-visibility/AO term (what
   actually makes overcast relief read in photographs), which needs a research note and the
   corpus first.
2. **Three GPU tests fail on pristine HEAD** (unchanged): `cover::gpu_wetness_soaks_and_dries_
   on_the_formula`, `cover::gpu_surface_weathering_follows_the_map`,
   `voxel::gpu_voxel_snow_covers_the_top` (+2.1 h swap bias), plus the eleven-instance adapter
   cap that splits the clouds suite.
3. **`day_night` never shows the sun or the moon** (unchanged): yaw 106.7° against dawn azimuth
   64° and sunset 303°; the 23:30 moon is set. The discs the domain exists for cannot appear.
4. **The small cosmetic set** (unchanged): `STRIKE_LEAD=6` outlives the ~43 ms flash decay;
   splash rings sparse; near-shore foam sub-pixel at nadir; the flood marker outside the
   capture frustum; erosion-cut faceting; the status line clipping at the window edge.
5. **Cloud shadow contrast under Clear is still unverified** (carried twice): iteration 5's
   crop missed the cloud mass; capture with cumulus upwind and measure the ground's
   depressions.

## Iteration 8 — 2026-10-15 — day_night frames the sun and the moon

**Commit:** `79e5e36` (examples only: `day_night`, `common::FlyCamera`, README, CHANGELOG — no
`src/` change). **Sibling repos:** none.

### What changed, and why it ranked first

The extra instruction again: inspect every feature with the vision model. Two inspection batches
(`/tmp/i8/review_a.md`, `/tmp/i8/review_b.md`, Gemini Flash `screenshot-reviewer`) closed every
rank-1/2 candidate: batch B passed the whole post-dome showcase (sky gradient monotone ≤ 2 DN
per 20 px, horizon continuous with zero shelf, prop top-vs-side shading 17–20 DN, terrain relief
5–8 DN with sub-1-DN speckle, cloud temporal pair at AE 0, rain streaks advection-coherent at
+9 DN against sky and +48 against ground) — **ship-shape**. The open categories therefore fell
to rank 3, and batch A measured the winner with a **Defect** verdict: **`day_night` never shows
the sun or the moon**. Its camera was aimed at bearing 253° (WSW) at +6° pitch while the bodies
sat elsewhere the whole sweep — sunrise 54–65° (ENE, behind), noon 180° at 68° up, sunset 304°
(past the 292° frustum edge), and the waxing moon at 150–175° (south, never in frustum): the
one example whose stated purpose is the celestial discs captured none of them in seven hours.
It beat the runner-up (an occlusion term for the aerial snow relief) because the runner-up
refines a fix the same reviewer already passed this week, while this is a whole missing feature
of the showcase the loop's inspection checklist names explicitly.

**The fix**: an `aim_at_sky` system (`PostUpdate`) turns the camera at the sun while it is
above the horizon, at the moon once the sun is down and the moon is up, and back at the spawned
evening heading when neither is up (`SunState`'s directions; yaw from the same `atan2` the
`camera()` helper uses). While the clock runs the aim follows the bodies; paused
(`ELEMENTS_HOUR`) it aims once (`Local<bool>`), so a still is framed on the disc and the view
stays free to drag — holding the right button releases the aim, which resumes on release. A new
`FlyCamera::face(yaw, pitch)` writes the controller's private fields.

### Verification

- Reviewer round 2 over the same seven hours (`/tmp/i8/review_c.md`, verdict **Ship**): the sun
  disc (10 × 10 px, core 255, centred within 2 px of frame centre) at 04:30 (alt 1.6°), 05:30
  (11.2°), noon (68.3° — the horizon sensibly out of the bottom of frame) and 19:36 (1.3°); the
  crescent moon (4 × 8 px, 37 % illumination faithful, 104–129 DN over the twilight sky) at
  20:12 and 21:30; 23:30 falls back to the evening heading with both bodies set (moon −1.8°) —
  stars-only, near-black ground (7,4,2). Sky checks unchanged from round 1: row steps ≤ 1 DN at
  every pitch, stars 1–2 px, no banding, no status-band occlusion (>300 px clear).
- Gates: `cargo test` 12 suites ok; `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`,
  `RUSTDOCFLAGS=-D warnings cargo doc --no-deps --all-features`, wasm32 clean. GPU (one process
  per suite): `clouds::` 10 + 1 in the documented two parts (the eleven-instance adapter cap
  fired once when the suite ran whole — `GPU_NOT_FOUND`, not a regression), `dust::` 6,
  `cover::` 5/2, `voxel::` 0/1 (the three pre-existing failures from iteration 4's backlog
  item 2), integration 11 binaries.

### Top 5 remaining items, ranked

1. **Occlusion for the aerial snow relief** (carried): the dome curve gives the aerial view
   3–8 DN; a sky-visibility/AO term is what photographs actually use. Needs a research note and
   a corpus-first search (sky occlusion course notes exist in the corpus: SIGGRAPH 2015 "Sky
   Occlusion", 2006 "horizon shadowing", 2021 "Horizon Occlusion").
2. **Three GPU tests fail on pristine HEAD** (unchanged): `cover::gpu_wetness_soaks_and_dries_
   on_the_formula`, `cover::gpu_surface_weathering_follows_the_map`,
   `voxel::gpu_voxel_snow_covers_the_top` (+2.1 h swap bias); plus the eleven-instance adapter
   cap that requires the clouds suite to run in two parts (in AGENTS).
3. **The small cosmetic set** (unchanged): `STRIKE_LEAD=6` outlives the ~43 ms flash decay
   (the doc says "inside the flash"); splash rings sparse on a 6 m roof; near-shore foam
   sub-pixel at nadir; the flood marker outside the capture frustum; erosion-cut faceting; the
   status line clipping at the window's right edge.
4. **Cloud shadow contrast under Clear is still unverified** (carried twice): iteration 5's
   crop missed the cloud mass; capture with cumulus upwind and measure the ground's shadow
   depressions.
5. **The moon's phase is the only moon feature exercised** (new): the aim fix frames the disc,
   and the reviewer confirmed the 37 % crescent renders faithfully — but no sweep has inspected
   the full moon (a month's phase sweep at a fixed hour) or the moon lighting terrain at
   different phases. Cheap to capture (`WorldClock` date), worth one batch.

## Iteration 9 — 2026-10-16 — cloud shadow and illuminance at a point

**Commits:** `c4f9340` (research note), `13f1092` (implementation, example, test, README), `cd77f34` + `da1a7ce` (0.5.1 release, changelog; the second makes `Environment`'s moon term optional so no new resource is required). **Sibling repos:** none. **Aspect:** clouds (iterations 7 and 8 were ground cover and sky).

**Shipped:** merged to `main` (`1e4c0f3`), tag `v0.5.1`, published at https://crates.io/crates/bevy_elements/0.5.1.

### What changed, and why it ranked first

Gameplay could ask for wind, water, snow and wetness at a point but not for light: the cloud shadow map was GPU-only and `CloudShadows::camera_transmittance` is one number for 70 m around the camera. A stealth system, a shade-seeking creature, a solar panel or a growth model needs the cloud shadow and the light **at a position**. New: `Environment::cloud_shadow_at(Vec3) -> Option<f32>` (direct transmittance toward the light, the position projected along the light as the ground material does, 1 outside the 8 km map, `None` before the first readback) and `Environment::illuminance_at(Vec3) -> f32` (clear-sky sun + moon × Kasten & Czeplak's `0.25 + 0.75·T`). The `cloud_shadow` kernel stores every fourth texel's `T` in a 256² buffer (31.25 m cells) inside the existing dispatch; the 4 Hz readback copies it with the origin and light direction captured at request time. Cost: `elements_clouds_shadow` 0.083 → 0.087 ms (min, High, 3840×2160, P2 1590–1725 MHz). New example `cloud_shadow_probes`: a 15×15 grid of unlit markers coloured by the query (yellow open, blue shadowed) with the centre's lux on screen and logged every 120 frames.

| `/tmp/i9/a_pc_above.png` (PartlyCloudy 11:00, 120 m, −25°) | (a) ground shadows, (b) probes | Defect (major): no shadow crossed the 560 m grid (0/225) — test-design defect, fixed by height-scaled spacing and a heading scan |
| `/tmp/i9/b_pc_grazing.png` (6 m, −3°) | (a), (b) | Defect: same cause (0/225) |
| `/tmp/i9/c_clear_above.png` (Clear) | (a), (b) | Pass |
| `/tmp/i9/d_pc_afternoon_high.png` (17:00, 400 m, −45°) | (a), (b) | Defect: grid wholly in one shadow (225/225, probes all blue, consistent) — no edge in view |

| `/tmp/i9/seq_sheet.png` (6 frames, 1.5 s apart) | (b) temporal stability | Pass (r6): probes stable, lux readout smooth; r3's "blocker" was the 0/225 grid of round 1 |

| `/tmp/i9/f_pc_1500.png` (1500 m, −55°, 250 m spacing) | (a), (b) | Defect (major) → resolved by crops: the patch is faint at 2–3 km (haze); crops show the probe colour change on it |
| `/tmp/i9/g_pc_800.png` (800 m, −35°, 150 m) | (a), (b) | Defect (major) → resolved by crops: in-patch probes are partial blends (thin cloud), readout threshold 0.5 |

### Defects found, fixed, re-shot

- Round 1 grid never met an edge (40 m spacing, 560 m): the example's spacing now scales with height (`ELEMENTS_SPACING`, default height/3 ≥ 40 m), the readout is logged, and a heading scan (0–315°, 120 m) found shadowed probes at 270° and 315° — re-shot as j/k, both **Pass** with edges.
- Grazing (a) investigated rather than assumed: a throwaway build tinted `t < 0.5` blue in `weathered.wesl` (reverted, rebuilt). The ground's `t < 0.5` pixels lie exactly where the blue probes are (rows 288–336 of n), and there the debug tint's red channel still reads ~95 DN: the aerial perspective adds ~95 DN at 0.3–1 km, so a ¼-light shadow reads 8 % darker. Query and render agree; the contrast loss is haze.

### Defects still open

1. **Grazing cloud shadows are washed out by the haze** (minor; not this change): from 6–40 m the nearest PartlyCloudy shadows over the origin are 0.3–1 km out, where inscatter adds ~95 DN; they read 4–8 % darker. The note's grazing target (a) is unmet; an example with a shadow nearer the camera, or a check that the haze level at 1 km under `PartlyCloudy` is right, is the follow-up.

### Verification

- New tests: `query::tests` (2, headless: `None` before a readback and the cover estimate for the light; a shadowed cell, its neighbour, a raised point projected along the light, outside the map, illuminance ratio 0.25) and `gpu_clouds::the_cloud_shadow_query_reads_the_shadow_map` (2 704 samples, mean |query − map| 0.0000, 1 314 lit / 1 247 dark, 27 324–109 298 lx).
- Gates: `cargo build --release`, `cargo test` (all suites ok), `cargo build --examples --all-features`, clippy `-D warnings`, `RUSTDOCFLAGS=-D warnings cargo doc`, wasm32 — clean. GPU: integration binaries all ok (gpu_clouds 5, hydrology 9, imports 1, precipitation 6, water 2, weathered 4, wind 2); lib `terrain::`, `dust::` ok; `clouds::` 10 + `the_horizon_sky` 1 ok; `cover::` 5/2 and `voxel::` 0/1 — the three documented pre-existing failures.

### Top 5 remaining items, ranked

1. **Grazing cloud shadows vs haze** (new, open item 1): verify the `PartlyCloudy` aerial perspective at 1 km against the visibility the weather states (95 DN of inscatter at 1 km is a lot for 20+ km visibility); if it is right, frame a near shadow in an example.
2. **Three GPU tests fail on pristine HEAD** (unchanged): `cover::gpu_wetness_soaks_and_dries_on_the_formula`, `cover::gpu_surface_weathering_follows_the_map`, `voxel::gpu_voxel_snow_covers_the_top`.
3. **Occlusion for the aerial snow relief** (carried).
4. **The moon's phase sweep / moonlit terrain** (carried); `illuminance_at` now gives a number to check the moonlight against (full moon ≈ 0.1–0.3 lx).
5. **The small cosmetic set** (carried): `STRIKE_LEAD`, sparse roof splashes, nadir foam, flood marker, erosion faceting, status-line clipping.

## Iteration 10 — 2026-10-16 — gameplay queries stay fresh without a window

**Commits:** `3ad816d` (research note `docs/research/readback-pacing.md`), implementation + test + docs, 0.5.2 release, this log. **Sibling repos:** none.

**Shipped:** merged to `main` (`b6a690a`), tag `v0.5.2`, published at https://crates.io/crates/bevy_elements/0.5.2. **Aspect:** gameplay queries / GPU readback (iterations 8 and 9 were sky and clouds).

### What changed, and why it ranked first

Backlog item 2, the three GPU tests failing on pristine HEAD since iteration 4, turned out to be a consumer-visible bug, not test noise. Traced (temporary prints in `readback.rs`, reverted): in an app with no window every readback's request-to-delivery latency went 2, 4, 8 … frames and the last delivery of any field was 3.1 s into the run; 85 s later `Environment::wetness` answered 0.325 while the map read 0.0. Only presenting a swap chain makes the CPU wait for the GPU, so a headless app (a server, a simulation tool, every GPU test) queued frames without bound and every gameplay query froze on the state of its first seconds. A non-blocking `Poll` per frame only moved the freeze to 23 s: the queue, not the callbacks, was the cause. Windowed apps were fine (`cloud_shadow_probes` logged `snapshot_age` 250 ms, one interval, over 1500 frames).

**The fix**: `pace_without_window` (`src/gpu/readback.rs`, `Render`/`PostCleanup`, after `map_buffers`): a frame with no `ExtractedWindow` waits for its own GPU work (`RenderDevice::poll(PollType::wait_indefinitely())`), so the queue is bounded at one frame and each readback lands on the next frame. With a window it returns at once. No-op on WebGPU.

It ranked first over the haze item (backlog 1): measuring the haze showed the distance fog's colour already matches Bevy's horizon (fog ≈ 0.53 linear display vs horizon sky 0.6–0.7) and the 30 km `PartlyCloudy` extinction gives 12 % fog at 1 km, so the iteration-9 "95 DN of inscatter" was the auto exposure lifting sunlit ground beyond a cloud shadow, not a fog defect — no change there (left in the backlog as a capture item, below).

### Candidates scored (1–5)

| Candidate | Game hook | Visible | Correctness | Cheap | Sum | Ownership |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Readbacks freeze without a window (backlog 2's root cause)** | 5 | 1 | 5 | 5 | **16** | ours |
| Grazing cloud shadows vs haze (backlog 1) | 1 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 9 | ours (measured: no fog defect) |

| Moon phase sweep / moonlit terrain (backlog 4) | 1 | 3 | 2 | 5 | 11 | ours (sky: last two iterations) |
| Mesh distance fog double-counts the 40 km clear-air floor that Bevy's aerial perspective also draws | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 11 | ours (Bevy's ground extinction is ~2×10⁻⁵ m⁻¹ against the 9.8×10⁻⁵ floor: ≤ 2 % at 1 km) |
| Save/restore of the weather state | 4 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 10 | ours |

### Inventory and shot list (Gemini Flash `screenshot-reviewer`, `/tmp/i10/review1.md`)

The change creates and alters no visual element: the wait never runs in a windowed app. The inventory is therefore the windowed frame itself, checked before/after.

| File | Inventory element | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `/tmp/i10/pair_PartlyCloudy.png` (`base_tour_PartlyCloudy.png` vs `after_tour_PartlyCloudy.png`, `weather_tour` noon) | windowed frame unchanged | **Pass**: 1 px of 921 600 differs by 1 LSB (GPU noise); sky, clouds, horizon, ground, props identical |
| `/tmp/i10/pair_Overcast.png` (`base_tour_Overcast.png` vs `after_tour_Overcast.png`) | windowed frame unchanged | **Pass**: bit-identical (same SHA-256); no banding, shelf or black holes in either half |

### Defects found, fixed, re-shot

None visual. The functional defect is the change itself.

### Defects still open

None from this change.

### Verification

- New test `tests/gpu_readback.rs::the_queries_stay_fresh_without_a_window` (`Ultra`, 256² terrain, 100 ms interval, 1200 frames): oldest snapshot **683 ms before** the fix (fails the 200 ms limit), **83 ms after**.
- Gates: `cargo build --release`, `cargo test` (all suites ok), `cargo build --examples --all-features`, clippy `-D warnings`, `RUSTDOCFLAGS=-D warnings cargo doc`, wasm32 — clean. GPU, one process per suite: integration binaries all ok (gpu_clouds 5, hydrology 9, imports 1, precipitation 6, readback 1, water 2, weathered 4, wind 2); lib `terrain::` 8, `cover::` **7/7**, `dust::` 6, `voxel::` **1/1**, `clouds::` 10 + `the_horizon_sky` 1. **The whole GPU suite is green for the first time since iteration 4.**
- Note for the loop: `.omp/skills/bevy-elements-build-loop/SKILL.md` §6.5 still lists the three tests as pre-existing failures; they now pass and any failure is a regression (the skill is user-authored, so it is not edited here).

### Top 5 remaining items, ranked

1. **Occlusion for the aerial snow relief** (carried).
2. **The moon's phase sweep / moonlit terrain** (carried); `illuminance_at` gives the number to check (full moon ≈ 0.1–0.3 lx).
3. **Save/restore of the weather state** (new to the top 5): a game hook for save games — `Weather`, `WorldClock`, the director's schedule and the cover/water layers.
4. **Grazing cloud-shadow capture** (re-scoped from iteration 9's item 1): the fog is right; frame a shadow within 300 m of a grazing camera so the shadow contrast can be judged without 1 km of air.
5. **The small cosmetic set** (carried): `STRIKE_LEAD`, sparse roof splashes, nadir foam, flood marker, erosion faceting, status-line clipping.

## Iteration 11 — 2026-10-16 — the weather can be saved and restored

**Commits:** `7a0a241` (research note `docs/research/weather-save.md`), implementation + test, 0.5.3 release, this log. **Sibling repos:** none.

**Shipped:** merged to `main` (`8f90456`), tag `v0.5.3`, published at https://crates.io/crates/bevy_elements/0.5.3. **Aspect:** climate and weather / save state (iterations 9 and 10 were clouds and GPU readback).

### What changed, and why it ranked first

Backlog item 3. A game could serialize `WorldClock`, `Climate`, `GeoLocation` and `Weather`, but not `WeatherDirector`: private fields, no `serde`, no `Reflect`. A reloaded save therefore started a fresh director, which arms at `Clear` on its first frame, drops a forced preset, cuts a blend in progress, and then walks a different Markov chain (each hour's step depends on the previous preset). `WeatherDirector` and its private `Blend`, `Transition` and `Request` now derive `Reflect`, `PartialEq` and (feature `serde`) `Serialize`/`Deserialize`. The scheduler's draws are a pure hash of `(seed, hour)`, so the chain position is the only state; no RNG cursor exists to save. The highest Game hook of the open items, a small CPU-only surface, no GPU cost. The GPU layers (snow cover, wetness, water, terrain) are out of scope and listed below.

### Candidates scored (1–5)

| Candidate | Game hook | Visible | Correctness | Cheap | Sum | Ownership |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Save/restore of the weather director (backlog 3)** | 5 | 1 | 4 | 5 | **15** | ours |
| Save/restore of the GPU layers (cover, water, terrain) | 5 | 1 | 3 | 1 | 10 | ours (needs whole-layer readback and upload) |
| Occlusion for the aerial snow relief (backlog 1) | 1 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 10 | ours |
| Moon phase sweep / moonlit terrain (backlog 2) | 1 | 3 | 2 | 5 | 11 | ours |
| Grazing cloud-shadow capture (backlog 4) | 1 | 3 | 1 | 5 | 10 | ours (capture only) |

### Inventory and shot list (Gemini Flash `screenshot-reviewer`, `/tmp/i11/review1.md`)

The change creates and alters no visual element (CPU derives only). The inventory is the windowed frame, before (`main`, `/tmp/base`) and after.

| File | Inventory element | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `/tmp/i11/pair_PartlyCloudy.png` (`base_`/`after_PartlyCloudy.png`, `weather_tour` noon) | windowed frame unchanged | **Pass**: 0 px differ at 2 % fuzz, max 2/255 |
| `/tmp/i11/pair_Thunderstorm.png` (`base_`/`after_Thunderstorm.png`) | windowed frame unchanged | **Pass**: 0.3 % px differ, all thin rain streaks (a 2×2 opening removes every one); mean signed delta ≈ 0, no sky/cloud/ground change |

### Defects found, fixed, re-shot

None.

### Defects still open

None from this change.

### Verification

- New `tests/save.rs` (`required-features = ["serde"]`, `serde_json` dev-dependency): a director saved through JSON after 72 game hours and loaded into a fresh app gives the same `Weather` as the uninterrupted run at all 720 updates of the next 72 h (with preset changes in that window); restoring only the clock diverges; a director saved one hour into a two-hour forced Thunderstorm blend restores forced, at the same blend, and reaches 25 mm/h. Before the fix the test does not compile (`WeatherDirector: serde::Serialize` not satisfied).
- Gates: `cargo build --release`, `cargo test` (all suites ok), `cargo test --features serde --test save` (2 ok), `cargo build --examples --all-features`, clippy `-D warnings`, `RUSTDOCFLAGS=-D warnings cargo doc`, wasm32 — clean. GPU, one process per suite: gpu_clouds 5, hydrology 9, imports 1, precipitation 6, readback 1, water 2, weathered 4, wind 2; lib `terrain::` 8, `cover::` 7, `dust::` 6, `voxel::` 1, `clouds::` 10 + `the_horizon_sky` 1 — all ok.
- `hs status` failed in the loop's shell ("No such device or address", no TTY); research used the synced corpus (Gregory 2018 §16.4.5) and the existing climate-weather sources.

### Top 5 remaining items, ranked

1. **Save/restore of the GPU layers** (new): snow cover, wetness, water and terrain live in storage buffers; a save needs a whole-layer readback and a restore an upload through `Assets<ShaderBuffer>`.
2. **Occlusion for the aerial snow relief** (carried).
3. **The moon's phase sweep / moonlit terrain** (carried); check against `illuminance_at` (full moon ≈ 0.1–0.3 lx).
4. **Grazing cloud-shadow capture** (carried): frame a shadow within 300 m of a grazing camera.
5. **The small cosmetic set** (carried): `STRIKE_LEAD`, sparse roof splashes, nadir foam, flood marker, erosion faceting, status-line clipping.

## Blocked pass — 2026-10-17 — the Opus 5.5 reviewer cannot run

No iteration was started. The skill's preflight sent one image to the `screenshot-reviewer` agent (`openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-5.5`) before any capture, and it failed in 0.6 s:

> 402 This request requires more credits, or fewer max_tokens. You requested up to 65536 tokens, but can only afford 42467. To increase, visit https://openrouter.ai/workspaces/default/keys/bd57b3406fa7580c26d459649a68144eccacb275026701a7bfaf041bef55a088 and adjust the key's monthly limit

Every iteration needs a GREAT verdict from this reviewer, so the pass stopped (skill Rules: a reviewer that cannot run is a blocker). Unblock by raising the OpenRouter key's monthly limit. 42 467 affordable output tokens at $20 per 1M is about $0.85 left, under one multi-image review.

State at the stop: `main` at `096719b`, every gate and GPU suite green (2026-10-17). home-still healthy (distill idle on CUDA, both scribes up). The backlog is unchanged from iteration 11, plus the crate-review fixes F1–F11 that landed between iterations (`12ad5f3`..`4cf0527`). F12 (bind groups re-created every frame) was not fixed and is not measured.

Second pass, same day: the reviewer preflight failed again in 0.4 s, `402 … You requested up to 65536 tokens, but can only afford 42177.` The key's limit has not been raised; the pass stopped before any capture.

Third pass, same day: preflight failed again, `402 … can only afford 42174.` Stopped before any capture.

## Iteration 12 — 2026-10-17 — twilight, the sunset exposure and the night sky

**Commits:** `5a96d37` (research note `docs/research/twilight.md`), `2559c3f` (implementation + `tests/gpu_twilight.rs`), `80f3772` (README, CHANGELOG, `celestial.md` Deviation 19, regenerated stills), this log. **Sibling repos:** none. **Not released** (the loop no longer bumps, tags or publishes). **Visual judgment:** by the loop agent itself (user decision 2026-10-17, after the Opus 5.5 reviewer hit OpenRouter's credit limit three passes in a row).

### What changed, and why it ranked first

The baseline sweep (29 captures, `/tmp/i12/before/`, findings in `/tmp/i12/critique.md`) found three linked defects in the sky, each measured on a linear `Rgba16Float` target:

1. **Every night sky was brown, ~40 DN.** Bevy's default `ClearColor` (sRGB 43, 44, 47) is written behind the sky before any exposure and Bevy's atmosphere draws over it with its transmittance: a constant linear (0.022, 0.0205, 0.0186) behind every sky pixel with every light off, on four dates.
2. **Twilight did not exist.** The sun's light was switched off at −2° (an unsourced M1 constant), so from −2° to −18° Bevy's atmosphere had no light; what showed was item 1.
3. **The low sun blew the frame out.** The illuminance-metered exposure left the sky toward the sun at 6–20× display peak from +12° to −2° (`dn_dusk.png` zenith 245 DN; `wt_sun_18.6` 252 DN).

Fixed: the sun lights the atmosphere to −18°, scaled below the horizon by `g(h)` fitted on Bevy's renderer to Hulburt's measured zenith twilight (`k` 0.44/° to −6°, then Hulburt's own 0.983/°); below the horizon its cloud factor is the dome's total so the composite's `sky_gain` is 1; the precipitation draw takes the sun only while its disc is up; the auto exposure is the larger of the illuminance target and a cap from the sky toward the sun (Patry 2021's highlight threshold, ceiling 3.2× display peak, the glow at a 27° sun); a camera that kept Bevy's default clear colour is cleared to the night sky's own glow (`E_floor/π` = 1.6×10⁻⁴ cd/m²) at its exposure.

It ranked first because the twilight sky had no light source at all, wrong for an hour of every evening in any game with a day cycle, and its fix also needed the exposure and the background. Runner-up: the flat, washed-out terrain shading on `hills` and `mountains`, a matter of degree rather than a missing light.

### Candidates ranked

| # | Candidate | Category | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Twilight missing, brown night sky, low-sun blowout** | 1 (wrong sky for the time) | picked |
| 2 | Flat terrain shading (`tt_hills42_eye`, `tt_mtn_elev`) | 2 (beauty) | runner-up |
| 3 | Night thunderstorm rain reads as white static (`storm.png`) | 2 | needs a look at streak brightness under a flash |
| 4 | Clouds in twilight flat grey; moonlit cloud rims | 2 | cloud lighting below `SUN_HANDOVER_DEG` |
| 5 | Pillar edge steps through the cloud composite (`dn_dusk` 4× crop) | 1 (cosmetic) | composite against geometry |
| — | Backlog: GPU-layer save, aerial snow occlusion, moon phase sweep, grazing shadow capture, cosmetic set | | carried |

### Critique and verdicts (`/tmp/i12/critique.md`; before `/tmp/i12/before/`, after `/tmp/i12/after/`)

| Feature | Evidence | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Twilight sky, toward the sun (−2.2° … −10.9°) | `after/tw/wt_sun_19.{0,3,6,9}.png`, `cmp/sheet_wt_sun_19.3.png` | GREAT: violet sky over an orange band shrinking to a red afterglow under navy with stars |
| Twilight sky, away from the sun | `after/tw/wt_away_19.{0,3,6}.png` | GREAT: Earth's shadow under the pink Belt of Venus |
| Golden hour / sunrise exposure | `after/tw/wt_sun_18.6.png`, `wt_away_18.6.png`, `dn_dawn.png` | GREAT: no white field, orange cloud rims, silhouettes |
| Zenith (GPU) | `tests/gpu_twilight.rs` | 0.94×, 1.01×, 0.65× of Hulburt at −2.2°, −3.9°, −5.5°; blue-purple |
| Night background | `after/tw/wt_night_23.png`, `wt_*_21.2.png` | GREAT; cosmetic: the horizon reads (9,5,2) DN, the neutral glow reddened by the horizon transmittance, visible only stretched |
| Continuity | `/tmp/i12/lapse_after.png`, `lapse_after.gif` (19:24 → 22:36) | GREAT on round 3 (round 1: olive bloom then a snap to black from Bevy's multiple-scattering floor, fixed by the −6° tail; round 2: the same from `sky_gain` amplifying the night 250×, fixed by the dome-total cloud factor) |
| Clouds in twilight / moonlit | `after/tw/wt_sun_19.3.png`, `wt_sun_21.2.png` | not touched; NOT YET, next item |

Daytime regression check (MAE against before, same frames): every noon and terrain capture ≤ 0.002 except `wt_PartlyCloudy_noon` 0.086 and `wt_Fog_noon` 0.059 — deterministic (after-vs-after 0): a camera in a cloud shadow no longer opens up past the sunlit sky (0.4 stop darker, richer sky), kept and documented. `docs/storm.png` was not regenerated: its change is the flash moment (nondeterministic), not this iteration.

### Verification

- New tests: `tests/gpu_twilight.rs` (3 GPU tests; all three fail on `eaf51e0`: glow 21.9× peak, night floor 0.022, zenith ratio 0.066 against Hulburt's 0.18), `celestial` unit tests for the twilight factor, the disc factor, the glow cap's range and the sky gain once the sun has set.
- Gates: `cargo build --release`, `cargo test` (all ok, lib 221; `the_lightning_schedule_is_frozen` unchanged), flora/voxel feature tests, `cargo build --examples --all-features`, clippy `-D warnings`, `RUSTDOCFLAGS=-D warnings cargo doc`, wasm32 — clean. GPU, one process per file/module: clouds 5, hydrology 9, imports 1, plugins 1, precipitation 6, readback 1, twilight 3, water 2, weathered 4, wind 2; lib `clouds` 10 + `the_horizon_sky` 1, `terrain` 8, `cover` 7, `dust` 6 — all ok.
- Performance: no GPU pass added; the sun's shadow cascades are now off below −0.5° (they were on to −2°). `bench_elements` at the default 4K/High and at 1080p could not allocate: another tenant (`VLLM::EngineCore` 15.9 GB + `hs-distill-server` 7.5 GB) held 23.5 of the card's 24 GB. Measured at `ELEMENTS_QUALITY=low ELEMENTS_TERRAIN=none ELEMENTS_PRESET=PartlyCloudy`, 1920×1080, GPU P2 at 1755–1800 MHz logged in the same shell: total min 0.571 ms before, 0.558 ms after; every pass's minimum within 0.006 ms.
- `lake` example: out of GPU memory in the same shared-memory state (environment, not a defect).

### Top 5 remaining items, ranked

1. **Clouds in twilight and moonlight**: post-sunset cumulus are flat neutral grey (no warm underside for the first degrees, no sky tint), and moonlit cloud edges form a light rim around a dark core against the now-dark sky (`pick_light` hands over at −4°; `cloud_ambient` tint).
2. **A view-dependent exposure cap**: the glow cap ignores where the camera looks, so a camera facing away from a low sun is up to ~2.5 stops darker than the illuminance alone (`docs/dawn.png`); meter the brightest sky in the frame (Patry's screen highlights).
3. **Flat terrain shading** (runner-up): `hills` reads uniform green at noon, `mountains` pale at 16 h.
4. **Night thunderstorm rain** (`storm.png`): flash-lit streaks read as white static over a black sky.
5. **Save/restore of the GPU layers** (carried) and the cosmetic set (`STRIKE_LEAD`, sparse roof splashes, nadir foam, flood marker, erosion faceting, status-line clipping, the composite's pillar edge step).

## Iteration 13 — 2026-10-17 — clouds take the colour of the light that fills them

**Commits:** `9ec2c62` (research note, `clouds.md` Deviation 30), `8de42a5` (implementation + `tests/gpu_cloud_ambient.rs`; the note's Deviation 30 and Validation 22 rewritten to the shipped model), `d3af2cf` (README, CHANGELOG, regenerated stills), this log. Merged through a pull request. **Sibling repos:** none. **Not released.**

### What changed, and why it ranked first

The clouds' ambient (the diffuse light on their shaded sides) was `vec3(ambient)`, a neutral grey scalar whatever the sky, so after sunset every cloud was grey cardboard against a violet or navy sky (civil twilight base (57, 57, 59) under a violet sky; nautical twilight (76, 77, 77) against navy (49, 52, 68)). Backlog item 1 of iteration 12. The ambient now takes the chromaticity of the diffuse light it stands for: the clear sky's irradiance from the camera's atmosphere environment map (16 Fibonacci directions over the upper hemisphere, divided by the cloud factor the sun's light carries so the sky above the layer is undimmed, plus the night-sky background) plus the share of the light's beam the cloud above the sample has scattered, $E_\odot \hat l_y (1 - e^{-\tau_l})$. Its luminance is unchanged.

Round 1 (sky colour alone) gave royal-blue night clouds in a brown-black sky: the cube held a moonlit atmosphere negligible next to the airglow floor; adding the floor fixed it. Round 2 passed the twilight frames but the GPU veil test failed (far-row tint 0.249 vs 0.126) and the horizon capture showed why: the noon `Overcast` deck turned periwinkle above a white band, because deep in a thick deck only the ambient is left. Round 3 adds the scattered sun, the physical reason behind Hillaire's "slightly blue" clouds and his artists' desaturation knob, which the model therefore does not need.

### Candidates ranked

| # | Candidate | Category | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Grey cloud ambient against coloured twilight skies** | 1 (wrong colour for the light) | picked |
| 2 | View-independent exposure cap (anti-solar sky darker than its clouds at −8°) | 2 | runner-up, owns the nautical contrast |
| 3 | `tt_mtn_pc_aerial` 2-px dark line at y ≈ 298 | 1 (cosmetic) | |
| 4 | Overcast at −4° a featureless flat deck | 2 | |
| 5 | Rain at noon: a uniform near-sky wall | 2 | |

### Sources

Hillaire 2016 §5.5.1 (ambient from Frostbite's sky probe; desaturation because clouds came out slightly blue; single-colour ambient listed as the first thing to improve), Schneider & Vos 2015 (`s2015-advances-ppt-944-mb-pdf-5-mb-2`, ll. 1218–1240: ambient from the sky by time of day), Bevy 0.20 `atmosphere/environment.wesl` (the cube is `sample_sky_view_lut`, absolute radiance before exposure).

### Critique and verdicts (`/tmp/i13/critique.md`; before `/tmp/i13/before/`, after `/tmp/i13/after/`, horizon `/tmp/i13/hz/`)

| Feature | Evidence | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Civil twilight (−4.2°), PartlyCloudy and Overcast | `wt_*_sun_19.2`, `wt_Overcast_away_19.2` | GREAT: violet-grey base (62, 55, 62), rose-grey deck (136, 126, 135) |
| Nautical twilight (−8.1°) away from the sun | `wt_PartlyCloudy_away_19.6` | GREAT: mauve (81, 74, 83) from the glow that lights it; its brightness against the navy sky is the runner-up's |
| Golden hour (+1.8°) | `wt_PartlyCloudy_sun_18.6` | GREAT: warm taupe body (74, 59, 56) under the orange rim |
| Noon PartlyCloudy, Overcast, Snow, horizon | `r3_day.png`, `hz/sheet3.png` | unchanged neutral decks (round 2's blue overcast fixed) |
| Night (crescent moon) | `wt_*_21.2` | the night sky's hue (14, 11, 9) |
| Continuity | dusk lapse 19:00 → 21:48 (2026-06-15), 20 consecutive frames at 20:30 | monotone through the sun→moon handover, ≤ 1 DN a frame |

### Verification

- New test `tests/gpu_cloud_ambient.rs::the_deck_takes_the_colour_of_its_light`: dusk red/green 1.26 vs 1.02 neutral; noon blue/red 1.05× neutral, bounded to (1.0, 1.1) (the sky-colour-only build gave 1.27×); fails on `162c33b` (identical decks with and without the map). Validation 20 (veil) holds: far-row tint differences ≤ 0.036.
- Gates: `cargo build --release`, `cargo test` (0 failures), `cargo build --examples --all-features`, clippy `-D warnings`, `cargo doc` `-D warnings`, wasm32 — clean. GPU, one process per file/module: every `tests/gpu_*.rs` file and lib `clouds` (10), `terrain` (8), `cover` (7), `dust` (6), `voxel` (1), `the_horizon_sky` — all pass.
- Performance (`bench_elements`, `ELEMENTS_QUALITY=low ELEMENTS_TERRAIN=none ELEMENTS_PRESET=PartlyCloudy`, 1920×1080, P2 at 1740–1860 MHz logged in the same shell, two alternating rounds): `elements_clouds_march` min 0.190 / 0.184 ms before, 0.184 / 0.189 ms after; total 0.598 / 0.587 against 0.573 / 0.590 ms. No measurable cost. (The shared card still holds ~22 GB for other tenants; High/4K benches do not fit.)
- Stills: `docs/cloud_sunset.png`, `twilight.png`, `belt_of_venus.png`, `sunset.png` regenerated at their recovered poses (the base build reproduces the old stills to MAE ≤ 0.0008); `tour.gif` (noon) unchanged by this iteration.

### Next feature (user direction, 2026-10-17)

Asked to review the crate for the single feature most useful to game developers: **interactive ground trails** — feet, wheels and bodies pressing tracks into snow, sand and mud that new snowfall, wind and time erase. Every interaction the crate offers runs one way (environment → game: `Environment`, `WeatheredMaterial`, `PrecipitationBlocker` shelter); nothing a character does marks the world, and the terrain's 4 m cells cannot hold a footprint. Literature pulled for it: Sumner, O'Brien & Hodgins 1999 (arXiv 2302.08683), Alvarado et al. 2022 (`10.3389/frvir.2022.801856`), Su et al. 2023 (`10.1145/3610548.3618159`), Goswami 2024 survey (`10.1111/cgf.15059`), Hanák 2021 (MUNI thesis, surveys AC III, Batman, Rise of the Tomb Raider, HZD Frozen Wilds, TLOU II), Svensson 2019 (Umeå thesis), Barré-Brisebois 2014 (GDC), CRREL Report 90-9 (shallow-snow sinkage), Wong's Bekker table via NASA TM-20250006958, Tatarchuk 2006 POM (`s2006-advances-materials-10`).

### Top 5 remaining items, ranked

1. **Interactive ground trails** (the next iteration, above).
2. **A view-dependent exposure cap** (carried): meter the brightest sky in the frame.
3. **Flat terrain shading** (carried).
4. **Night thunderstorm rain** reads as white static (carried).
5. **Save/restore of the GPU layers** and the cosmetic set (the aerial's 2-px line at y ≈ 298, the composite's pillar edge step, `STRIKE_LEAD`, sparse roof splashes).
