//! Volumetric snow on [`bevy_isomesh`] voxel volumes (feature `isomesh`). The snow maps of the
//! ground cover run on a heightfield, so a voxel volume gets one of its own: [`VoxelGround`]
//! scans the top of every column of a `VoxelVolume` and spawns a crate-internal
//! [`Terrain`](crate::Terrain) with [`TerrainRender::External`](crate::TerrainRender::External)
//! over the volume's XZ extent whose heights are those tops. Hydrology, snow, wetness, wind and
//! rain then run on it unchanged, and [`SnowyField`] puts the snow depth back into the volume
//! as a slab over the column tops, so the mesh grows a snow cap and a tunnel under the hill
//! stays dark. See `docs/research/voxel-snow.md`.
//!
//! The frame: the user's edit systems, then [`VoxelGroundSystems`] (the first scan, the edit
//! pass, the snow swap), then bevy_isomesh's `IsomeshSystems`: anything the ground marks
//! `NeedsRemesh` is meshed in the same frame, once, against the new field.

/// Snow, wetness and hydrology for a `VoxelVolume`: put it on the volume's entity.

/// The volume keeps its own `field`; this crate wraps it in a [`SnowyField`] and swaps that in
/// as the snow changes, so every edit to the base field made through
/// [`VoxelVolume::replace_field`](bevy_isomesh::VoxelVolume::replace_field) is seen (it must be
/// ordered `.before(`[`VoxelGroundSystems`]`)` together with the `NeedsRemesh` marks of the
/// chunks it changed).
///
/// A volume with a `VoxelGround` owns the crate's [`Terrain`](crate::Terrain): spawn no other
/// (one terrain exists at a time) and no second `VoxelGround`. Its grid covers the volume's
/// chunk entities as they are at the first scan; chunks that appear later outside that box get
/// no snow. The chunk entities need identity transforms and no parent offset (field space is
/// world space), and the voxel cell size must be a power of two, as isomesh requires.
///
/// [`ErosionSettings::enabled`](crate::ErosionSettings) is ignored for voxel ground (one
/// warning is logged when it is on): the volume's field is the truth and erosion would rewrite
/// only the heightfield under it. Water still flows, and snow, wetness and rain run as on any
/// terrain.
///
/// A ground material on the volume's meshes must gate its snow and wetness by depth below the
/// column top, or a tunnel's walls are shaded white wherever the map above them has snow: see
/// [`GroundExtension::with_column_gate_m`](crate::GroundExtension::with_column_gate_m).
