//! Trails: footprints, ruts and tracks pressed into snow, sand, soil and mud
//! (`docs/research/trails.md`, `docs/research/trails-game-ground.md`).
//!
//! An entity with an [`Imprint`] presses into the ground under it while its translation (the
//! sole) is within 0.1 m of the undisturbed surface: as deep as the ground gives under its load
//! (Bekker–Wong sinkage, the CRREL compaction limit in snow), with a rim of the material it
//! cannot compress. The field is a centimetre window that follows the [`ElementsFocus`]
//! (else the camera), simulated on the GPU (stamp, merge, slump and wind) and drawn per pixel by
//! the terrain and ground materials and by a [`WeatheredMaterial`] that opts in. New snow fills
//! it, wind smooths it, melt takes it, wet sand and mud slump. The ground is the crate's
//! [`Terrain`](crate::Terrain) with its cover maps, or a game's own, described by a
//! [`TrailGround`].
