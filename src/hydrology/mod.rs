//! Hydrology and erosion: flooding, rivers and lakes as one shallow-water field on the terrain
//! grid (Mei et al. 2007 virtual pipes with a depth-dependent pipe area), hydraulic erosion with
//! flux-form sediment transport, and thermal erosion. See `docs/research/hydrology.md` and
//! `docs/research/erosion.md`.
//!
//! The simulation runs on the [`Terrain`](crate::Terrain)'s grid and writes its `water`, `flux`,
//! `velocity`, `suspended`, `bedrock` and `sediment` layers. It idles while there is no terrain.
//! Each frame runs a whole number of fixed substeps ([`HydrologySettings::step_s`]) scheduled
//! from real time; [`ErodeTerrain`] bakes erosion at the quality's full rate instead.
//!
//! Gameplay reads the water through
//! [`Environment::water_depth`](crate::Environment::water_depth) and
//! [`Environment::water_velocity`](crate::Environment::water_velocity); both are up to one
//! readback interval old.
